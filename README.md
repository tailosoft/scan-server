# Scan Server

Scan server is a Free to use alternative to many expensive solutions out there that allow scanning documents from Web applications.

## Project Structure

There are two projects:
1. ScanServer: Compiles into a .exe that can be run a standalone app or as a service
2. ScanServerInstaller: Create an MSI to make easier to download and install as Windows Service (Runs by default on http://localhost:5000).

## How to use

Just run/install the app.
List the devices on: http://localhost:5000/api/scanners

You can perform a scan and handle exceptions like this:
```
      const scanResponse = await fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/scan/${encodeURIComponent(scannerId)}`).catch(() => null);
      if (!scanResponse) {
        return Promise.reject('Failed to Perform Scan');
      }
      if (scanResponse.ok) {
        return new File([await scanResponse.blob()], `Scan-${+new Date()}`, { type: scanResponse.headers.get('Content-Type')! });
      } else {
        console.error('Failed to perform scan', scanResponse);
        if (scanResponse.status === 404) {
          return Promise.reject('Scanner not found');
        } else {
          return Promise.reject('Failed to Perform Scan');
        }
      }
```


## Getting started

To build this project:

```ps
cd .\ScanServer
rm -r .\bin\
dotnet clean
dotnet publish ScanServer.csproj -c Release
cd ..\ScanServerInstaller
rm -r .\bin\
dotnet clean
dotnet build -c Release
```

## Debug

To be able to attach the visual studio debugger on a running Windows Service, the project needs to be build in Debug and not release.

**Make sure to disable single file...**
```
dotnet build ScanServer.csproj -c Debug
```

Then create a Windows service **using cmd as administrator and not powershell** using the .exe in the debug file, make sure to stop the release server since they by default use the same port.
```
sc create ScanServerDebug binPath= "C:\Path\To\ScanServer\bin\Debug\net7.0\win-x64\ScanServer.exe" DisplayName= "Scan Server Debug" start= auto obj= "LocalSystem"
```

## Uninstall:

To uninstall start a command line as administrator and run:

```cmd
sc stop ScanServer
sc delete ScanServer
```

Then delete the install folder.

A huge thank you to @cyanfish and it's [NAPS2 SDK Project](https://github.com/cyanfish/naps2/) without whom/which building this would have taken a lot of time.

# TODO
Find a way to change the default port in the service either:
1. by configuring the service in the installer
2. Building the app with another default port while allowing --urls to work.
